<h1>Everything You Need to Know Before Building Your First Gaming PC</h1>
<p>Gaming has been a favourite pastime for decades and games themselves have come a long way since the early arcade days of Pong and Hunt the Wumpus that were released in the 1970s. Next gen games offer spectacular graphics, compelling storylines and innovative ways to interact with scenery, characters and plot. In recent years, PC gaming has been considered the pinnacle of gaming, though consoles are becoming more powerful with every iteration.</p>
<p>With the recent release of Sony&rsquo;s PS5 and Microsoft&rsquo;s XBox Series S and XBox Series S, console gaming has never been more closely aligned with the PC gaming experience. There is a catch, however, that anyone choosing between console gaming and PC gaming should be aware of: consoles are fixed and offer no real customisation options. While consoles are frequently upgraded in terms of software, their major limitation is with the fixed nature of their hardware, and this fact alone is enough to push many serious gamers towards PCs instead.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Is a PC build the right choice for you?</h2>
<p>While console gaming has become increasingly popular in recent years, PC gaming is still the preferred choice for many serious gamers. There are several reasons why building your own PC is the best option for gaming. First of all, PCs offer much more power and flexibility than consoles. This means that you can play the latest games on high settings and enjoy a smooth, lag-free experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, PCs are more upgradeable than consoles. So, if you want to add a new graphics card or upgrade your processor, you can do so without having to buy a whole new system. Finally, PCs are generally more affordable than consoles in the long run. With a little bit of research, you can put together a powerful gaming PC for a fraction of the cost of a high-end console. So, if you're looking to get serious about gaming, building your own PC is the way to go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that building a PC is usually more complex than buying one off the shelf, mainly because it involves quite a bit of research and understanding of what exactly goes into a gaming PC. Not only this, but you also need to be aware of the system requirements needed for the games you want to play, as well as ensuring that all the components you want to include are compatible with each other. All these factors go together to create a powerful and efficient <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="https://www.awd-it.co.uk/gaming-pc.html">gaming computer</a></strong></em></span> that will give you the best in-game experience possible.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Important components you need for your gaming PC build</h2>
<p>Any serious gamer will tell you that a gaming PC is only as good as its components. The three most important parts of any gaming PC are the processor, the graphics card, and the memory. The processor is responsible for running the game software and performing all the calculations needed to create the game world. The faster the processor, the smoother the gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The graphics card is responsible for generating the images that are displayed on the screen. A high-quality graphics card can make a big difference in visual quality, particularly when it comes to games with complex graphics or fast-paced action. Lastly, the memory is responsible for storing information about the game world and keeping track of changes that occur during gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A gaming PC needs enough memory to run the game software and store information about the game world, without running into issues like lag or stuttering. By ensuring that your gaming PC has a fast processor, a high-quality graphics card, and plenty of memory, you can be sure that you're getting the best possible gaming experience.</p>
<p>If you are interested in getting your hands on some of the best gaming components for your PC then the brands to look out for are Nvidia which produces impressive and diverse graphics cards, MSI which is known for its motherboards and complete gaming PC builds, and ASUS which makes an excellent range of central processing units and peripherals. There are also many smaller brands working in this sector that can provide you with more boutique components if you prefer to choose something more unusual in your build.</p>
